# Machine-Learning-Theory-and-Practice-Project

## Basic Description:
This project was assigned in my first semester of my graduate career at Florida Polytechnic University in a class titled "Machine Learning Theory and Practice". The goal of this project was to create a program that determines the most relevant parameters to determining who is more likely to have false insurance claims.
